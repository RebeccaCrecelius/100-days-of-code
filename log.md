# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Created a GitHub account. Connected VS Code to GitHub. Researched building apps, projects, repositories, ReadMe files, and licenses. Practiced making commits from VS Code directly to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** The direct connection between VS Code and GitHub is very helpful. I cannot figure out how to connect an existing repository to a project. The licenses and ReadMe information is confusing. Will update this information when I figure it out. I have two projects I would like to work on, but I need planning for both. 

### Day 2: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the rules again and forked the #100DaysOfCode repository. Checked to make sure changes to a forked repository will not effect the original. Joined the #100DaysOfCode Discord community. Did general research on popular website layouts. Started a general homepage layout. Decided for my first project I will further expand on one started during previous studies. Twemary will be an ice cream locator website and app. 

**Thoughts**: I am going to use this challenge as a way to practice JavaScript and front-end languages. I would also like to learn how to build apps. Although I prefer iOS, I will build the first app using JavaScript and React. This will give me more practice with these languages.
