# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Created a GitHub account. Connected VS Code to GitHub. Researched building apps, projects, repositories, ReadMe files, and licenses. Practiced making commits from VS Code directly to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** The direct connection between VS Code and GitHub is very helpful. I cannot figure out how to connect an existing repository to a project. The licenses and ReadMe information is confusing. Will update this information when I figure it out. I have two projects I would like to work on, but I need planning for both. 

### Day 2: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the rules again and forked the #100DaysOfCode repository. Checked to make sure changes to a forked repository will not effect the original. Joined the #100DaysOfCode Discord community. Did general research on popular website layouts. Started a general homepage layout. Decided for my first project I will further expand on one started during previous studies. Twemary will be an ice cream locator website and app. 

**Thoughts**: I am going to use this challenge as a way to practice JavaScript and front-end languages. I would also like to learn how to build apps. Although I prefer iOS, I will build the first app using JavaScript and React. This will give me more practice with these languages.

### Day 3: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewd the FAQs to see what to do when learning and/ ore reviewing a new technique. Ahtough it is suggested to use FreeCodeCamp's Front End Curriculum, I already use Codecademy. Reviewed and practiced CSS grid properties: grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-template, row-gap, column-gap, gap, grid-row-start, grid-row-end, and grid-area.

**Thoughts**: Although I know it is necessary to learn these properties to create a responsive website, I have a tough time conceptualizing them within context. Meaning, I have a tough time thinking of web design in a fluid manner, so it is hard for me to visualize how these properties will be used in real-world situations.

### Day 4: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Advanced CSS Grid topic via Codecademy: grid template areas. Practiced the technique and then attempted to work on Twemary using the lessons learned but was unable to connect the repository via VS Code using GitHub Codespaces. Did some brief research and could not figure out why this was happening. Sent a message reporting a bug, and then saw that a repository must have a README or a file to be read by VS Code. After committing a general index.html boilerplate directly through GitHub, I was able to connect the Codespace to VS Code. Connected the Codespace and added another commit to include a CSS folder with file. 

**Thoughts**: GitHub is becoming more familiar, and I am starting to understand the general functionality of these tools working together. One hour of coding is not a lot, but it is helpful to have a dedicated time set aside. I am looking forward to building the Twemary website and am happy to know more about grids. 

### Day 5: February 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Modified color palette for accessibility purposes. Outlined the structure of the webpage. Began adding navigation text. Could not remember whether the css stylesheet should appear after or before the title in the head of the html document. Discovered both would work as long as it is in the head. However, placing it after the title allows for the title to be recognized by international characters (see additional information link.)  Created a server so that I could view the project in a browser using the GitHub workspace via VS Code (see resource link.)

**Thoughts**: This is the first time I have accessed the terminal via VSCode. I also did not know you could create your own server this way. The process was straightforward and clear. However, I am not entirely sure why I have two windows up in VSCode now. One shows the previous version of a document, and one shows the workflow.

### Day 6: February 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Tried to access the project via the link created yesterday. However, it was not working. Did some research and the only suggestion was that the repository would need to be public. I am not ready to make the repository public. Decided to work locally so I can view my progress in the browser. After each session, I will update GitHub with the new versions until I am ready to make the repository public for editing purposes. Added CSS styling and linked the stylesheet for the local version. Continue working on html structure. Added placeholder image for the header. 

**Thoughts**: So far, I have spent a great deal of time troubleshooting and learning GitHub. That is wonderful. However, when a person is only working for one hour it does not leave a lot of time for project building.

### Day 7: February 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added code to clear browser styling. Linked Google Fonts styling. Fixed issue with background color and image in the banner. 

**Thoughts**: In order to make further progress, I may continue working on this today. 

**Issues**: The web page is not showing up the same in browsers. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge do not show the webpage's changes. Firefox does show the changes.
