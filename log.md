# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Created a GitHub account. Connected VS Code to GitHub. Researched building apps, projects, repositories, ReadMe files, and licenses. Practiced making commits from VS Code directly to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** The direct connection between VS Code and GitHub is very helpful. I cannot figure out how to connect an existing repository to a project. The licenses and ReadMe information is confusing. Will update this information when I figure it out. I have two projects I would like to work on, but I need planning for both. 

### Day 2: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the rules again and forked the #100DaysOfCode repository. Checked to make sure changes to a forked repository will not effect the original. Joined the #100DaysOfCode Discord community. Did general research on popular website layouts. Started a general homepage layout. Decided for my first project I will further expand on one started during previous studies. Twemary will be an ice cream locator website and app. 

**Thoughts**: I am going to use this challenge as a way to practice JavaScript and front-end languages. I would also like to learn how to build apps. Although I prefer iOS, I will build the first app using JavaScript and React. This will give me more practice with these languages.

### Day 3: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewd the FAQs to see what to do when learning and/ ore reviewing a new technique. Ahtough it is suggested to use FreeCodeCamp's Front End Curriculum, I already use Codecademy. Reviewed and practiced CSS grid properties: grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-template, row-gap, column-gap, gap, grid-row-start, grid-row-end, and grid-area.

**Thoughts**: Although I know it is necessary to learn these properties to create a responsive website, I have a tough time conceptualizing them within context. Meaning, I have a tough time thinking of web design in a fluid manner, so it is hard for me to visualize how these properties will be used in real-world situations.

### Day 4: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Advanced CSS Grid topic via Codecademy: grid template areas. Practiced the technique and then attempted to work on Twemary using the lessons learned but was unable to connect the repository via VS Code using GitHub Codespaces. Did some brief research and could not figure out why this was happening. Sent a message reporting a bug, and then saw that a repository must have a README or a file to be read by VS Code. After committing a general index.html boilerplate directly through GitHub, I was able to connect the Codespace to VS Code. Connected the Codespace and added another commit to include a CSS folder with file. 

**Thoughts**: GitHub is becoming more familiar, and I am starting to understand the general functionality of these tools working together. One hour of coding is not a lot, but it is helpful to have a dedicated time set aside. I am looking forward to building the Twemary website and am happy to know more about grids. 

### Day 5: February 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Modified color palette for accessibility purposes. Outlined the structure of the webpage. Began adding navigation text. Could not remember whether the css stylesheet should appear after or before the title in the head of the html document. Discovered both would work as long as it is in the head. However, placing it after the title allows for the title to be recognized by international characters (see additional information link.)  Created a server so that I could view the project in a browser using the GitHub workspace via VS Code (see resource link.)

**Thoughts**: This is the first time I have accessed the terminal via VSCode. I also did not know you could create your own server this way. The process was straightforward and clear. However, I am not entirely sure why I have two windows up in VSCode now. One shows the previous version of a document, and one shows the workflow.

### Day 6: February 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Tried to access the project via the link created yesterday. However, it was not working. Did some research and the only suggestion was that the repository would need to be public. I am not ready to make the repository public. Decided to work locally so I can view my progress in the browser. After each session, I will update GitHub with the new versions until I am ready to make the repository public for editing purposes. Added CSS styling and linked the stylesheet for the local version. Continue working on html structure. Added placeholder image for the header. 

**Thoughts**: So far, I have spent a great deal of time troubleshooting and learning GitHub. That is wonderful. However, when a person is only working for one hour it does not leave a lot of time for project building.

### Day 7: February 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added code to clear browser styling. Linked Google Fonts styling. Fixed issue with background color and image in the banner. 

**Thoughts**: In order to make further progress, I may continue working on this today. 

**Issues**: The web page is not showing up the same in browsers. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge do not show the webpage's changes. Firefox does show the changes.

### Day 8: February 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Fixed alignment of the header company name and navigation links. Added navigation colors. Included a Lorem Picsum image for the hero image. Updated html to include a secondary font for the H2 element. Updated CSS for the H2 element as well. 

**Thoughts**: The website is coming along. It was helpful to step away and come back to the issue regarding the alignment of elements in the header. 

**Issues**: The header background does not reach the extend to the entire width of the screen. 

### Day 9: February 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added additional placeholder images for the body. Started styling the footer. Adjusted the position of the hero image. Reviewed Advanced CSS grid techniques for overlapping elements, justify items, justify content, and align items. 

**Thoughts**: Much of the CSS will likely have to be modified in order to achieve responsive design. As for content, I do not really know what to write. It is hard to get inspired right now. 

**Issues**: An alignment issue occurred with the h2 element after I centered the hero image. There is also a problem with the alignment of text in the footer and the positioning of the footer has a general issue. There is a block of color which interrupts the background. 

### Day 10: February 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Fixed footer. All elements are aligned, and the footer extends properly. Fixed header alignment as well. 

**Thoughts**: I started today reviewing grids, because I thought it would be needed to update all the CSS for responsiveness. However, I do not know if this is true or not. I am also confused as to whether you keep traditional tags such as "footer" and "header" if using columns. I was not very motivated today. 

### Day 11: February 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added content and styling to the body text. 

**Thoughts**: An hour is not a long time to code.

### Day 12: February 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Was able to align the features next to each other. Changed the hearo image to properly reflect the outline created during the early stages of this project. Added a border box to the content below the hero image and aligned it according to the outline. Used grids and columns for alignment. Changed hero and features images to represent the outline more accurately.

**Thoughts**: Although it does not feel like an hour is a long time to code, I have noticed that sticking to that time frame is motivating me to research solutions in a more efficient manner. This is helping with overall development time and less confusion. I am also retaining information better. 

**To Do**: The items within the features columns need to be centered. This may require changing display: inline-grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; to flexbox under .features. Need to double-check to see if I need to change some of the overall sizing to percentages for accessibility reasons. Currently, the information under the hero image is labeled as an h2. It needs to be a p with a hidden h2 element. 

### Day 13: February 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Changed the .features section to flex. Aligned the images and text for features by treating the .feature element as a parent. Aligned the image for community. Partly aligned the text for community. 

**Thoughts**: I am looking forward to adding more visual branding soon. 

**To Do**: Trade the placeholder images out for brand-specific images. Fix the text for the community section. Gather all materials for Twemary including images and product/ company text. 

### Day 14: February 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Aligned community elements next to each other using a grid. Started aligning content within the grid itself. 

**Thoughts**: I am not sure if I should break the grid into smaller sections to properly space the elements. I am hoping that I can align them by keeping the number of columns and rows to a minimum. 

**To Do**: Fix the alignment of the grid container so that it stays aligned with the features section when resized. Fix the width of the p element so the border takes up the proper space and add the proper spacing to the right side of the grid container as well. 

### Day 15: February 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Changed grid for the community section to a flex grid. Backed up code which contained code which had been commented out. Cleaned up code to only include that which is currently being used. 

**Thoughts**: For some reason, I am having a challenging time aligning the img and p elements of the community section. When looking at the outline for the website, I noticed that the problem may be due to the fact that the two elements do not take up the exact same amount of space. However, when I do not use a flex grid, the items do not align properly when the screen is resized. This is why I changed the grid type to a flex grid. 

**To Do**: Align the community section. Map out the other pages. Add the assets to the folder and start using brand-specific images to ensure that dimensions will not affect the final result.

### Day 16: February 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added a font-size to html in CSS and changed all unit measurements to the relative value of rem. Fixed the alignment of the p content in the community section. Aligned the header and footer elements and fixed the sizing. Created a fully responsive design. 

**Thoughts**: I am looking forward to adding media queries tomorrow.

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix the right and left side of the community section so it lines up with the rest of the main content. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. 

### Day 17: February 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Corrected the overall margins to features. Fixed the proportions of the .community img and p elements. Aligned the text for community. Continued to work on aligning the community section based on a more refined replication of the design. Fixed the a element color so that it was set to a specific brand color rather than inherited. 

**Thoughts**: It would be ideal if the text in the .community p element were not centered using padding. If it were centered automatically, it would not be affected based on the adding and subtracting of text. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix the right and left side of the community section so it lines up with the rest of the main content. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. 

### Day 18: February 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Fixed margins so they are even across the page. Added column gaps so the elements remain spaced when the screen is resized. Sizing of features and community are now correct. 

**Thoughts**: It is exciting when you finally figure out a problem. I noticed that the original design also had space around the hero image. I noticed the same thing with the navigation and footer areas of the original design. I will need to look at other websites to see if these sections should also have spacing. I would also like to make the elements in those sections stretch further across the screen. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. 

### Day 19: February 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added about and contact pages. 

**Thoughts**: I do not know why, but I am  unable to align the text in the header and footer to take up more width in the screen. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. 

### Day 20: March 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added content and images. Started problem-solving a call-to-action for the header.

**Thoughts**: I reviewed code from Codecademy of the call-to-action. However, when I tried some of what was shared, it broke the code on the entire page. I am not sure how much this addition will complicate matters. I would also like to dedicate more time to this website as I wish it were farther along. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. Fix the text in the features section so it does not overflow when the screen is resized. 

### Day 21: March 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Codecademy for ways to add a button in a hero. Added id selectors, but it broke the code. However, eventually, I think that it will make the website more functional. 

**Thoughts**: I hope I can figure out how to add the button, because now the page is completely illegible. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. Fix the text in the features section so it does not overflow when the screen is resized. Add the CTA to the header and fix the overall website with the new classes and sections. 

### Day 22: March 3, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added the button and styled it with brand colors. Started adding styling the cta text. 

**Thoughts**: This will take some patience, but I think it will work out. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Still need to gather brand assets and place them within the folder, but I think it will be best to do this once all items are aligned properly. Fix the text in the features section so it does not overflow when the screen is resized. Add the CTA to the header. 

### Day 23: March 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Relinked the hero image. Aligned the sign-up section so that it floats to the bottom left of the hero image. Changed the header to include a logo without the company name. Will use the logo as a link back to the homepage. Started adding more brand colors and styling. Aligned feature items. 

**Thoughts**: I am relieved to have the sign-up section figured out. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix community and footer section. Create a logo and brand materials for Twemary. Still need to gather assets and place them within the folder. 

### Day 24: March 5, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on re-aligning the content. However, the solution I came up with is not responsive when the screen resizes. Started cleaning up the code by deleting unused code. Figured out how to access previous commits on GitHub. 

**Thoughts**: I am a little worried I will not be able to figure out how to fix the community section so that it is responsive. I would like to finish with this structural component of the homepage so that I can devote more time to branding. I also need to create the layouts for the other two pages. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix community and footer section. Create a logo and brand materials for Twemary. Still need to gather assets and place them within the folder. 

### Day 25: March 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Placed community elements in a flex grid. The text does not overflow in this section when resized. 

**Thoughts**: I realize the solution for the overflow text in the feature section is to create an auto value for the height. However, doing such also makes the sizing wrong between the text boxes which are next to each other. Also, I was able to get the spacing between the image and text in the community section to be like the design. However, there were issues with the image when resizing. I am not sure how to align the items using flexbox so that they are properly spaced when viewed in full screen mode and when resized. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix community and footer section. Create a logo and brand materials for Twemary. Still need to gather assets and place them within the folder. Fix overflow text in feature section. Fix spacing in community section. 

### Day 26: March 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I am still working on the features and community sections. I fixed the overflow text in the feature section. 

**Thoughts**: I am wondering if I should start the CSS over completely. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix community and footer section. Create a logo and brand materials for Twemary. Still need to gather assets and place them within the folder. Fix spacing in community section. 

### Day 27: March 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I refined the spacing in the navigation and fixed the spacing of the call-to-action. Also, fixed the responsiveness of the text in the features section. 

**Thoughts**: I do not know how to fix the community section. Also, the footer got broken somehow, and now I need to figure out how to make it extend the width of the page again. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix community and footer section. Create a logo and brand materials for Twemary. Still need to gather assets and place them within the folder. Fix spacing in community section. 

### Day 28: March 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to view a private repository in a browser via VS Code. Uploaded images for Twemary to the GitHub repository. 

**Thoughts**: There are changes which need to be synced before I can make any further commits using VS Code. I tried to figure out how to resolve the issue, but I cannot figure it out. Asked for help via GitHub discussions. 

**To Do**: Add media queries. Fix community and footer section. Create a logo and brand materials for Twemary. Still need to gather assets and place them within the folder. Fix spacing in community section. Sync changes.
