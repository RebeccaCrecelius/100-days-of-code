# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Created a GitHub account. Connected VS Code to GitHub. Researched building apps, projects, repositories, ReadMe files, and licenses. Practiced making commits from VS Code directly to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** The direct connection between VS Code and GitHub is very helpful. I cannot figure out how to connect an existing repository to a project. The licenses and ReadMe information is confusing. Will update this information when I figure it out. I have two projects I would like to work on, but I need planning for both. 

### Day 2: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the rules again and forked the #100DaysOfCode repository. Checked to make sure changes to a forked repository will not effect the original. Joined the #100DaysOfCode Discord community. Did general research on popular website layouts. Started a general homepage layout. Decided for my first project I will further expand on one started during previous studies. Twemary will be an ice cream locator website and app. 

**Thoughts**: I am going to use this challenge as a way to practice JavaScript and front-end languages. I would also like to learn how to build apps. Although I prefer iOS, I will build the first app using JavaScript and React. This will give me more practice with these languages.

### Day 3: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewd the FAQs to see what to do when learning and/ ore reviewing a new technique. Ahtough it is suggested to use FreeCodeCamp's Front End Curriculum, I already use Codecademy. Reviewed and practiced CSS grid properties: grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-template, row-gap, column-gap, gap, grid-row-start, grid-row-end, and grid-area.

**Thoughts**: Although I know it is necessary to learn these properties to create a responsive website, I have a tough time conceptualizing them within context. Meaning, I have a tough time thinking of web design in a fluid manner, so it is hard for me to visualize how these properties will be used in real-world situations.

### Day 4: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Advanced CSS Grid topic via Codecademy: grid template areas. Practiced the technique and then attempted to work on Twemary using the lessons learned but was unable to connect the repository via VS Code using GitHub Codespaces. Did some brief research and could not figure out why this was happening. Sent a message reporting a bug, and then saw that a repository must have a README or a file to be read by VS Code. After committing a general index.html boilerplate directly through GitHub, I was able to connect the Codespace to VS Code. Connected the Codespace and added another commit to include a CSS folder with file. 

**Thoughts**: GitHub is becoming more familiar, and I am starting to understand the general functionality of these tools working together. One hour of coding is not a lot, but it is helpful to have a dedicated time set aside. I am looking forward to building the Twemary website and am happy to know more about grids.
