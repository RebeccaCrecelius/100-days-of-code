# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Created a GitHub account. Connected VS Code to GitHub. Researched building apps, projects, repositories, ReadMe files, and licenses. Practiced making commits from VS Code directly to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** The direct connection between VS Code and GitHub is very helpful. I cannot figure out how to connect an existing repository to a project. The licenses and ReadMe information is confusing. Will update this information when I figure it out. I have two projects I would like to work on, but I need planning for both. 

### Day 2: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the rules again and forked the #100DaysOfCode repository. Checked to make sure changes to a forked repository will not effect the original. Joined the #100DaysOfCode Discord community. Did general research on popular website layouts. Started a general homepage layout. Decided for my first project I will further expand on one started during previous studies. Twemary will be an ice cream locator website and app. 

**Thoughts**: I am going to use this challenge as a way to practice JavaScript and front-end languages. I would also like to learn how to build apps. Although I prefer iOS, I will build the first app using JavaScript and React. This will give me more practice with these languages.

### Day 3: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewd the FAQs to see what to do when learning and/ ore reviewing a new technique. Ahtough it is suggested to use FreeCodeCamp's Front End Curriculum, I already use Codecademy. Reviewed and practiced CSS grid properties: grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-template, row-gap, column-gap, gap, grid-row-start, grid-row-end, and grid-area.

**Thoughts**: Although I know it is necessary to learn these properties to create a responsive website, I have a tough time conceptualizing them within context. Meaning, I have a tough time thinking of web design in a fluid manner, so it is hard for me to visualize how these properties will be used in real-world situations.

### Day 4: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Advanced CSS Grid topic via Codecademy: grid template areas. Practiced the technique and then attempted to work on Twemary using the lessons learned but was unable to connect the repository via VS Code using GitHub Codespaces. Did some brief research and could not figure out why this was happening. Sent a message reporting a bug, and then saw that a repository must have a README or a file to be read by VS Code. After committing a general index.html boilerplate directly through GitHub, I was able to connect the Codespace to VS Code. Connected the Codespace and added another commit to include a CSS folder with file. 

**Thoughts**: GitHub is becoming more familiar, and I am starting to understand the general functionality of these tools working together. One hour of coding is not a lot, but it is helpful to have a dedicated time set aside. I am looking forward to building the Twemary website and am happy to know more about grids. 

### Day 5: February 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Modified color palette for accessibility purposes. Outlined the structure of the webpage. Began adding navigation text. Could not remember whether the css stylesheet should appear after or before the title in the head of the html document. Discovered both would work as long as it is in the head. However, placing it after the title allows for the title to be recognized by international characters (see additional information link.)  Created a server so that I could view the project in a browser using the GitHub workspace via VS Code (see resource link.)

**Thoughts**: This is the first time I have accessed the terminal via VSCode. I also did not know you could create your own server this way. The process was straightforward and clear. However, I am not entirely sure why I have two windows up in VSCode now. One shows the previous version of a document, and one shows the workflow.

### Day 6: February 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Tried to access the project via the link created yesterday. However, it was not working. Did some research and the only suggestion was that the repository would need to be public. I am not ready to make the repository public. Decided to work locally so I can view my progress in the browser. After each session, I will update GitHub with the new versions until I am ready to make the repository public for editing purposes. Added CSS styling and linked the stylesheet for the local version. Continue working on html structure. Added placeholder image for the header. 

**Thoughts**: So far, I have spent a great deal of time troubleshooting and learning GitHub. That is wonderful. However, when a person is only working for one hour it does not leave a lot of time for project building.

### Day 7: February 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added code to clear browser styling. Linked Google Fonts styling. Fixed issue with background color and image in the banner. 

**Thoughts**: In order to make further progress, I may continue working on this today. 

**Issues**: The web page is not showing up the same in browsers. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge do not show the webpage's changes. Firefox does show the changes.

### Day 8: February 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Fixed alignment of the header company name and navigation links. Added navigation colors. Included a Lorem Picsum image for the hero image. Updated html to include a secondary font for the H2 element. Updated CSS for the H2 element as well. 

**Thoughts**: The website is coming along. It was helpful to step away and come back to the issue regarding the alignment of elements in the header. 

**Issues**: The header background does not reach the extend to the entire width of the screen. 

### Day 9: February 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added additional placeholder images for the body. Started styling the footer. Adjusted the position of the hero image. Reviewed Advanced CSS grid techniques for overlapping elements, justify items, justify content, and align items. 

**Thoughts**: Much of the CSS will likely have to be modified in order to achieve responsive design. As for content, I do not really know what to write. It is hard to get inspired right now. 

**Issues**: An alignment issue occurred with the h2 element after I centered the hero image. There is also a problem with the alignment of text in the footer and the positioning of the footer has a general issue. There is a block of color which interrupts the background. 

### Day 10: February 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Fixed footer. All elements are aligned, and the footer extends properly. Fixed header alignment as well. 

**Thoughts**: I started today reviewing grids, because I thought it would be needed to update all the CSS for responsiveness. However, I do not know if this is true or not. I am also confused as to whether you keep traditional tags such as "footer" and "header" if using columns. I was not very motivated today. 

### Day 11: February 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added content and styling to the body text. 

**Thoughts**: An hour is not a long time to code.

### Day 12: February 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Was able to align the features next to each other. Changed the hearo image to properly reflect the outline created during the early stages of this project. Added a border box to the content below the hero image and aligned it according to the outline. Used grids and columns for alignment. Changed hero and features images to represent the outline more accurately.

**Thoughts**: Although it does not feel like an hour is a long time to code, I have noticed that sticking to that time frame is motivating me to research solutions in a more efficient manner. This is helping with overall development time and less confusion. I am also retaining information better. 

**To Do**: The items within the features columns need to be centered. This may require changing display: inline-grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; to flexbox under .features. Need to double-check to see if I need to change some of the overall sizing to percentages for accessibility reasons. Currently, the information under the hero image is labeled as an h2. It needs to be a p with a hidden h2 element. 

### Day 13: February 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Changed the .features section to flex. Aligned the images and text for features by treating the .feature element as a parent. Aligned the image for community. Partly aligned the text for community. 

**Thoughts**: I am looking forward to adding more visual branding soon. 

**To Do**: Trade the placeholder images out for brand-specific images. Fix the text for the community section. Gather all materials for Twemary including images and product/ company text. 

### Day 14: February 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Aligned community elements next to each other using a grid. Started aligning content within the grid itself. 

**Thoughts**: I am not sure if I should break the grid into smaller sections to properly space the elements. I am hoping that I can align them by keeping the number of columns and rows to a minimum. 

**To Do**: Fix the alignment of the grid container so that it stays aligned with the features section when resized. Fix the width of the p element so the border takes up the proper space and add the proper spacing to the right side of the grid container as well. 

### Day 15: February 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Changed grid for the community section to a flex grid. Backed up code which contained code which had been commented out. Cleaned up code to only include that which is currently being used. 

**Thoughts**: For some reason, I am having a challenging time aligning the img and p elements of the community section. When looking at the outline for the website, I noticed that the problem may be due to the fact that the two elements do not take up the exact same amount of space. However, when I do not use a flex grid, the items do not align properly when the screen is resized. This is why I changed the grid type to a flex grid. 

**To Do**: Align the community section. Map out the other pages. Add the assets to the folder and start using brand-specific images to ensure that dimensions will not affect the final result.
